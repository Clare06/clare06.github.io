              <h1>WHO I AM?</h1>
              <p>
                Hello, I'm Claretes Nishoban, an undergraduate student pursuing a BSc (Hons) degree in Information Technology at the University of Moratuwa. I am a passionate software engineer with expertise in technologies like Springboot, Angular, and MySQL. Additionally, I have experience working on projects involving PHP and C.
                <br/><br>
                My journey into the technology world began with a love for playing games, which eventually sparked my interest in software engineering. Companies like Samsung, Google, and Activision, with their innovative products, further fueled my motivation to become a part of this dynamic field. Additionally, the quote "Leap of faith," which I encountered in the movie "Into the Spiderverse," resonates with my approach to taking on new challenges and embracing new opportunities.
                <br/><br>
                Apart from my academic and professional pursuits, I have diverse interests that keep me balanced. I enjoy table tennis and chess, appreciate movies with seamless integration, love to explore new places through travel, and find joy in gaming.
                <br/><br>
                As a software engineer, I am not afraid to explore unconventional approaches and seek innovative solutions. My experience in PHP and C, along with my expertise in Springboot and Angular, has broadened my skill set and reinforced my commitment to delivering quality work.
                <br/><br>
                I am excited about the endless possibilities in the world of software engineering and look forward to contributing to the advancement of technology, perhaps even venturing into the fascinating domain of AI in the future. Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities together!

        <h2>Project: Ensuring Children's Safety in School Buses and Schools</h2>

        <h3>Aim:</h3>
        <p>Design and develop a comprehensive system to enhance the safety of children who travel to school by bus.</p>
      
        <h3>Objectives:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a system utilizing RFID cards to accurately track children's presence on school buses and within the school premises.</li>
          <li>Develop a messaging mechanism to notify parents when their children board the bus and arrive at school.</li>
          <li>Implement an alert system to detect any children left behind on the bus after it's parked and alert the driver.</li>
          <li>Design a door control mechanism with an ON/OFF switch for controlled access to the bus.</li>
        </ol>
      
        <h3>Project Description:</h3>
        <p>
          The project aims to enhance the safety and security of children commuting to school by bus. It encompasses the development of a sophisticated system that ensures the well-being of students during their daily journeys. The system employs RFID technology to meticulously monitor the presence of children both on the bus and within the school premises. Timely notifications are sent to parents, offering them reassurance about their children's safety.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          My role within the project was the integration of a GSM module with Atmega 32 microcontroller. This integration empowered the system to send messages to parents and drivers, providing real-time updates on the children's whereabouts. My focal contribution was in the domain of C programming, configuring and optimizing the GSM module's functionality to facilitate seamless communication.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Additionally, I played a key role in developing the system's user interface. Leveraging my expertise in PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I crafted an intuitive UI that manages the database and supports overall system operations. The interface enhances efficient data management, contributing significantly to the smooth functioning of the safety system.

        <h2>Project: Route Optimization Application for Enhanced Delivery Efficiency</h2>

    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Our project revolves around the development of an innovative application tailored to the needs of manufacturing businesses seeking to optimize their order delivery processes. The application focuses on providing companies with intelligently routed maps for delivering goods, taking into account various constraints. By doing so, it significantly enhances operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness, ultimately contributing to enhanced productivity.</p>

    <h3>Key Features:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Efficient Routing:</strong> The application's core functionality lies in generating optimized delivery routes that adhere to specific constraints. This feature ensures that goods are delivered with the utmost efficiency and minimal cost.</li>
        <li><strong>Constraint Consideration:</strong> The application takes into consideration various constraints such as delivery time windows, vehicle capacities, and road restrictions. This ensures that the generated routes are not only efficient but also practical.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive Mapping:</strong> Visual representations of the optimized delivery routes on interactive maps provide users with a clear understanding of the delivery paths and points.</li>
        <li><strong>User-Focused Dashboard:</strong> A user-friendly dashboard is designed for warehouse personnel, allowing them to create orders, manage backhaul operations, and select vehicles for routing. The dashboard also includes profile editing, login, and password recovery functionalities.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced User Management:</strong> The application includes robust user management capabilities, ensuring secure user authentication, profile editing, and password recovery.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>My Role:</h3>
    <p>In this project, I played a pivotal role as a team leader and contributor. My responsibilities encompassed the creation of orders, management of backhaul operations, and compiling vehicle lists for efficient routing. I was also actively involved in developing the user-friendly dashboard tailored for warehouse users.</p>
    <p>Leveraging my skills in Angular, Spring Boot (REST), and MySQL, I contributed to the implementation of essential features that enabled efficient order and delivery management. Additionally, my role extended to user management, reinforcing the application's security and user authentication aspects.</p>

    <p>The Route Optimization Application represents a culmination of our team's efforts to streamline delivery operations, bolstering delivery efficiency, and cost-effectiveness for manufacturing companies.</p>
