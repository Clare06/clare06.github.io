              <h1>WHO I AM?</h1>
              <p>
                Hello, I'm Claretes Nishoban, an undergraduate student pursuing a BSc (Hons) degree in Information Technology at the University of Moratuwa. I am a passionate software engineer with expertise in technologies like Springboot, Angular, and MySQL. Additionally, I have experience working on projects involving PHP and C.
                <br/><br>
                My journey into the technology world began with a love for playing games, which eventually sparked my interest in software engineering. Companies like Samsung, Google, and Activision, with their innovative products, further fueled my motivation to become a part of this dynamic field. Additionally, the quote "Leap of faith," which I encountered in the movie "Into the Spiderverse," resonates with my approach to taking on new challenges and embracing new opportunities.
                <br/><br>
                Apart from my academic and professional pursuits, I have diverse interests that keep me balanced. I enjoy table tennis and chess, appreciate movies with seamless integration, love to explore new places through travel, and find joy in gaming.
                <br/><br>
                As a software engineer, I am not afraid to explore unconventional approaches and seek innovative solutions. My experience in PHP and C, along with my expertise in Springboot and Angular, has broadened my skill set and reinforced my commitment to delivering quality work.
                <br/><br>
                I am excited about the endless possibilities in the world of software engineering and look forward to contributing to the advancement of technology, perhaps even venturing into the fascinating domain of AI in the future. Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities together!
