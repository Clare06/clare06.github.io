    "bio": "I approach technology with the instincts of a gamer and the discipline of an engineer. Whether I'm architecting event-driven systems or crafting a user interface, my goal is simple: to create flow. I believe the best work happens when we take a 'Leap of Faith' into the unknown. I bring that courage—backed by a deep technical foundation—to every project I touch. Let's build something extraordinary."
